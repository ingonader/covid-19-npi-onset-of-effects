# Onset of effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19

Analysis related to the preprint on medarxiv: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20185660v1

With contributions from:

* Dana Jomar
* Clemens Zauchner



## Goal of the Analysis

* Estimate average effect of individual measures (as opposed to effects of measure bundles implemented at the same time in a specific country)
* Estimate the onset of effects: How long does it take for each measure to affect the growth rate
* Using a non-parametrical approach (random forest) and ALE plots to visualize what the model has learned from the data
* bootstrap analysis to estimate variability in effects
