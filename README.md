# Onset of effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19

Analysis related to: Nader, I.W., Zeilinger, E.L., Jomar, D., & Zauchner, C. Onset of effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 infection rates in 176 countries. *BMC Public Health* **21,** 1472 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11530-0

With contributions from:

* Dana Jomar
* Clemens Zauchner



## Goal of the Analysis

* Estimate average effect of individual measures (as opposed to effects of measure bundles implemented at the same time in a specific country)
* Estimate the onset of effects: How long does it take for each measure to affect the growth rate
* Using a non-parametrical approach (random forest) and ALE plots to visualize what the model has learned from the data
* bootstrap analysis to estimate variability in effects
